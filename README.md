This package is based on the computational strategies described in the following paper:

Mohamadou Sall and M. Anwar Hasan 'On NTT Facilitating Normal Bases Over Binary Fields'.
A longer version entitled 'On efficient normal bases over binary fields' is available on 
arXiv, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11544

The primary objective is to explore various ranges of binary field extensions for both common 
and extended implementations. The central focus is on normal bases, whose efficiency stems from 
an adaptation to fast polynomial multiplication or convolution product. The package includes the 
file 'NormalBasesWithNTT.m,' which uploads the necessary data and contains functions for establishing 
tables for fast multiplication. The new data are based on results on normal bases and algebraic groups, 
CPU micro-architecture properties, and some software design. Potential applications span software and 
hardware field arithmetic, coding theory, and cryptographic processes.

Handbook of Finite Fields website: https://people.math.carleton.ca/~daniel/hff/#tables.
